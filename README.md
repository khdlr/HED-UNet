# HED-UNet

Code for HED-UNet, a model for simultaneous semantic segmentation and edge detection.

## Glacier Fronts

This model was originally developed to detect calving front margins in Antarctica from Sentinel-1 SAR imagery.

## Building Footprints

As the original dataset isn't publicly available, this repository contains an adaption of the model for building footprint extraction on the [Inria Aerial Image Labeling dataset](https://project.inria.fr/aerialimagelabeling/). Here are some example results:

## Usage

In order to use this for your project, you will need adapt either the `get_dataloader` function in `train.py` or the methods in `data_loading.py`.
