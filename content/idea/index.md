This study for automatically mapping glacier calving fronts was inspired by observing how a human would annotate land and glacier areas in a satellite image:

{{< video src="annotating.webm" >}}

During the annotation process, thoughts like the following might run through the annotators head:

1. "Good thing I can zoom in and out as needed"
2. "Iâ€™ll start with the edge"
3. "Give me a bigger brush!"

The proposed HED-UNet model was designed by incorporating these ideas.
